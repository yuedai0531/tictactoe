# tic tac toe game for RC

### areas of interest

I have been wanting to experiment more with Java streams.
There might be better implementations for some methods.

### how to play

you input row first (0, 1, 2) corresponding to 

| 0 | - | - |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | - | - |
| 2 | - | - |

then you input column (0, 1, 2) corresponding to

| 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|
| - | - | - |
| - | - | - |

game will not let you input a token (`X` or `O`) at a place that already has a token.

### improvements

- will probably write some tests, I've been wanting to learn more in depth mocks vs stubs vs create
- maybe try push pull or event driven?
- UX and UI could be improved HA!
- accessibility should be worked on.
